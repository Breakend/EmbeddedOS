Toward a final program
-----------------------

Here we will try encrypting and decrypting the assembly with an Arnold Cat Map.

Even though the Arnold Cat Map was intended for images, it can be applied here.

The equations are:

	x' = 2x + y   (all mod n?)
	y' = x + y

We divide the assembly into an "x" and "y" range ofequal sizes (i.e. n x n).

Scramble using a python script (TBD). Using above formula and line numbers (after the stack setup and making sure that labels are kept with the desired address) scramble the memory for 1 iterations (for now).

so given 9 lines, the mapping would be the following (assuming n = 3)

1								1  2  3			     
2					--->		4  5  6   ---> 
3								7  8  9		    1
4
5
6
7
8
9

In the program the address will be modified to accommodate for spacing inserted after (i.e. nops and jmps)

1(3, 2), 2(1, 3), 3(2, 1)
4(1, 1),
