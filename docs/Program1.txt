Program 1
-----------

This program is meant to test out the Arduino Uno and write a simple program in C to run it on the machine. From here, I will move onto a simple kernel. 

Intent:
	According to the schematic in the same folder, the on-board LED is connected to pin PB5 of the Atmega328p chip. The goal is to make it blink faster and faster to indicate that the program is running [somewhat] correctly.

Steps:

1. C script found in /src/Program1/
2. Generate IHEX file with avr-gcc
	# Commands used
	# Compile
	$ avr-gcc -Os -DF_CPU=16000000UL -mmcu=atmega328p -c -o led.o program1.c
	# Link
	$ avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega328p led.o -o led
	# Copy for eeprom
	$ avr-objcopy -O ihex -R .eeprom led led.hex
3. Load onto the chip

	# Note: the -P attribute might have to be changed from /dev/tty.usbmodem1411, depending on operating system and instance
	$ avrdude -F -V -c arduino -p ATMEGA328P -P /dev/tty.usbmodem1411 -b 115200 -U flash:w:led.hex

And done! It works.
