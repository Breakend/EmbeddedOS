Program 2
-----------

This program is meant to learn to use the linker (kind of) and to be able to load multiple programs onto the Arduino.

Intent:
	Create a "nano"-kernel that sits in the initial program slot. Another program (Ref: /Program1.txt) will be loaded into memory at some other address in space (TBD). The nano-kernel will then jump to the other address in space and begin running the other program.

Steps:

1. C scripts found in /src/Program2/
2. Compile scripts with linker settings starting at a certain location
3. Combine hex files with SRecord (installed with homebrew)
4. load combined hex onto arduino with avrdude
