EmbeddedOS
==========

This is a sandbox for a proof of concept white paper that I was/(am sporadically) working on. The concept is to chaotically randomize the program memory of embedded systems to protect against invasive malware or programs such as the Stuxnet virus. Currently this is a super messy sandbox so don't read too much into it. There is a functioning scrambled program using Arnold Cat Map algorithm to scramble the program memory. The program itself just blinks the light on an Arduino Uno at various rates.
